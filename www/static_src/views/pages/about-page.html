    Open Data Discovery is a project to track and present the up-to-date status of the world of open data. It collects information from {{ about.portalCount | number }} open data portals, including the number of published datasets, tags, categories, and publishers, in a weekly basis to show how they are acting. These data portals are established by nations, provinces, cities, and institutes worldwide, which are main force of the global activity of data openning. With the effort of constantly observing these portals, we hope to provide an overview of how data is opened worldwide from more perspectives and more dimensions.
